# etherpad-lite
A repo about etherpad running on Debian/Ubuntu. 

I've created a image about Etherpad hosted in Docker Hub so you can download and use the image in order to deploy it on a container using Docker.

This project has been inspired by Tlacuaches Project so feel free to contribute and try it.
